# 🏍️ Rider Kontrol : Wireless Handlebar Controller 

A Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) navigation remote for riders, by riders.


There’s nothing more frustrating (or dangerous) than trying to poke at a touchscreen with thick gloves while cruising at 65+ mph.

`Rider Kontrol` is a DIY wireless keyboard designed to mount directly to your motorcycle's handlebars. It allows you to control navigation apps (like DMD2, Gaia GPS, OsmAnd and other) without taking your hands off the grips.

## 🚀 Features
* Glove-Friendly: Large tactile buttons for easy navigation while riding.
* BLE Connectivity: Mimics a standard HID keyboard—no companion app required.
* Versatility: Built in and custom key maps, to support different navigation apps
* Low Power: Optimized for the ESP32-C3 to ensure long battery life between charges, powered by a 5V USB (direct from motorcycle cockpit USB port, or converted from the motorcycle's 12V battery).
* Weather Resistant: Designed to be housed in a 3D-printed, sealed enclosure.
* Low cost: DYI project with fully open source firmware

## 🛠️ Hardware
This project is built around the Arduino (ESP32) C3 Mini. Its compact footprint and native BLE support make it the perfect brain for a sleek handlebar remote.
