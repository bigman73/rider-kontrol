# Inspirations

## BarButtons

The [BarButtons](https://jaxeadv.com/barbuttons/) project has greatly inspired this project. We used the enclosure design as a baseline, but have plans for another much slimmer design.

Note: The firmware of BarButtons was not used, a different approach was taken, and Rider Kontrol firmware is written from scratch.
